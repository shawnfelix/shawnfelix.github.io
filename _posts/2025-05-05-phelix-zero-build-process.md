When I set out to create my own keyboard from scratch, I had minimal experience with how much time loss can compound in the assembly phase, when you make mistakes in your design phase...

During the design phase of a product there are many times that you can run into an unexpected but minor flaw. A screw alignment issue that wasnt forseen 4 hours prior. A part that you assumed would fit that doesn't actually fit. The shape of a part that just doesn't look quite right. 

And in the back of your mind, you have a tiny subversive voice whispers: 

>
> "Hey, there's no need to redo all of the work you just completed! You can simply fix the issue after production with a minute or two of elbow grease and a good power tool!"
>

 **That tiny voice in your head is <ins>EVIL</ins>.** 


**NEVER** listen to that voice. *One thing small piece to sand here, a small joint to solder there, and your product will be good!* 

After struggling with manual labor-intensive tasks for countless hours while assembling my first batch of phelix-zero keyboards, I swore I never would listen to that voice again. 

Here is the comprehensive list of shortcuts I deeply regret:
- Acrylic case sanded matte finish (+1 hr per keyboard)
- Threaded inserts for sandwich layer standoffs (+2 hrs)
- Laser cut 2D with solvent bonding layers instead of CNC plastic case (+5 hrs)
- Not double checking my design files (+5 hrs)
- Not double checking my design files again after reordering parts (+2 hrs)
- Ordering the wrong parts (+30 mins)
- Not investing in laser cut foam layer (+1 hr)
- Not ordering prototype parts to check for fitment (+5 hrs)


Dear hobbyists, don't be like me. Be diligent in the design phase. 

Automate the assembly process as much as you possibly can.
