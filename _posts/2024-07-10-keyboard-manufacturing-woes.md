Picking parts for my keyboard was a fun, but arduous task. 
When I started this project, I wanted to really test three things:
1. Could I truly create a consumer-ready physical product?
2. Are these electronic product companies choosing cheap components on purpose?
3. I dont have a third thing. 

<ins>The answer to question 1 is yes and no.</ins>

I would say that yes, I have a successful, consumer-ready product in the phelix-zero (and yes -- your order is still in progress)

I would also say no. On this journey, I've realized the level of time, effort, investment, and manpower it requires to truely deliver a high quality physical product at scale. 

Anyone who has built a physical product on their own should be able to resonate with my sentiment.

> Building a product is tough.

<ins>The answer to question 2 is also yes and no.</ins>

It's quite obvious that a company's primary obligation is to the shareholders. 

When you are designing a product that will be manufactured in quantities reaching six or seven figures, a half of a penny savings on a part can go a long way. So while a certain premium button might have a higher quality tactile feel than the cheaper alternataive, it can often not be in the companies best interest to choose the better part option.

I think if people really knew how many individual parts were in the thousands of consumer products they owned, they would have a much higher appreciation for mechanical engineers. 

Putting aside these companies reputation for introducing planned obsolescence, I think that most really do want to put out a high quality product. But man, looking at that parts sheet, realizing the margins per piece... Oof. 

It's tough to not feel greed.
